This project visualizes relationships across the Bible and related sources, providing a rich reference for pastors, scholars, and curious readers alike. Bible Atlas was created by a software engineer with a passion for biblical studies. It applies network and graph theory to connect ideas, themes, people, and places, offering both intuitive exploration and scholarly depth. What Bible Atlas Does Maps biblical relationships: who is connected to whom, familial lineages, tribal affiliations, and thematic links. Each page includes references, notes, and visualizations showing its connections to other pages. Includes Old Testament, New Testament, and extra-biblical references for every page. Highlights strong and weak connections to help identify important links and scholarly debates. Supports modular expansion : new pages, connections, or categories can be added via structured data (YAML) files. How to Use Browsing Search for primary agents like People , Places , Tribes , and Themes using the search bar or nav panel. Click on a page to view detailed information, references, notes, and visualizations of its connections. References Biblical references link to authoritative sources (BibleHub). Academic and extra-biblical references are listed for further study. Visualizations Each page may include charts showing connections (family, tribal, thematic). Charts are generated from the underlying data, so new pages automatically appear. Contributing Financial Contributors Someday, I would love to spend more than a few hours here or there on nights and weekends contributing to this project, but my day-job is still a big part of my life. Once I setup a way to donate, I'll have a way to track if this is a project that can be supported by my full-time work. I'll keep you posted. Academic Contributors As a Bible enthusiast, I hope that others who love to study the Bible want to contribute to this (rather large) potential body of work! I welcome emails and Software Dev Contributors We welcome contributions! To add new pages or update connections: Create or modify YAML files in the data/ folder. Run the build script to generate updated Markdown pages. Submit a pull request to the repository for review.
